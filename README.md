# Bankan
A simple Kanban Board, **To present my solid understanding of React Fundamentals,
React Performance, and familiarity with Typescript and Testing User Interfaces.**

Through this project I'm trying to focus on:
- Structure components and managed states in a way that prevents
unnecessary re-renderings.
- Use Linter and Static-Type Language and wrote Unit, Integration, and
e2e tests to reduce development phase mistakes and ensure the
application functions as expected.
- Use editorconfig, pre-commit hook and gitattributes to demonstrate
my awareness of the cross-platform teamwork challenges like EOL.
- Implement drag and drop and micro-animations to provide an
appealing user experience.
